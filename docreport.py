Doctor: Okay, and where is the pain exactly? Patient: It's just right over on the left side. Doctor: Okay, and when did this pain start? Patient: It started just 30 minutes ago. Doctor: Okay, and did it just come on randomly or were you doing something strenuous? Patient: I was just shoveling the driveway, and it came on. Doctor: Okay, and has that pain been getting worse at all over the last half an hour? Patient: No, it just came on suddenly and it's. Sorry. Yeah, the pain has been there this whole time and it's gotten worse ever since it started. Doctor: Okay, and how would you describe the pain? Is it kind of like an aching pain, or is it a sharp or tight tightness kind of pain? How would you describe it? Patient: It feels dull. I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my chest. Doctor: And how do you rate the pain right now on a scale of 0 to 10? 0 being the least amount of pain you felt in your life, 10 being the worst? Patient: Seven. Doctor: Seven. Have you had any similar episodes before? Patient: No, I've never had any chest pain before. Doctor: Okay, and is the pain just staying in the region, the left chest area that you mentioned, or is it traveling to any other part of your body? Patient: No, I'm kind of just feeling it right here on the left side. Doctor: Is there anything that you do that makes the pain either get worse or go away, or like, get better? Patient: I think it's a bit worse if I'm moving around or when I was walking in here. I think it made it a bit worse, but nothing has seemed to make it any better since it started. Doctor: And does it change at all from you changing positions, like if you're standing up versus sitting down or laying down? Patient: I think it's a little bit worse when I'm laying down. Doctor: Other than the pain that you've been having, have you been having any other symptoms, like a cough or difficulty breathing, or any pain when you're breathing in or out? Patient: I've felt a little bit short of breath or had difficulty breathing since the pain started, but just the difficulty breathing. Doctor: Okay. And have you recently injured your chest or surrounding area at all, like from a fall or anything like that? Patient: I do play rugby and was tackled by another player yesterday, but my chest felt fine after that. Doctor: Okay, but the pain just started half an hour ago? Patient: Yeah. Doctor: Have you been traveling at all recently? Patient: No. Been at home. Doctor: Has anyone around you been sick at all? Patient: No. Doctor: Have you had any symptoms like nausea or vomiting, or any fevers or chills? Patient: No nausea or vomiting, but I do feel a little bit hot today. Doctor: Okay. Have you measured your temperature at all? Patient: I did, and it was 38 degrees. Doctor: And have you been having any kind of swelling in your legs or feet? Patient: No swelling in my legs. Doctor: Have you been feeling tired at all, like increasingly fatigued? Patient: No, my energy has been good. Doctor: Have you been having any kind of thumping or palpitations or feel like your heart has been racing at all? Patient: It does feel like it's beating faster right now. It usually only feels like this when I'm playing sports. Doctor: And have you noticed any changes in your skin at all, any rashes? Patient: No rashes. Doctor: Have you had any cough, runny nose, or sore throat, or any of those symptoms in the past month? Patient: A few weeks ago, my nose was a little runny, but that went away on its own. I haven't had any cough. Doctor: Okay. And have you been feeling dizzy at all or have you fainted? Patient: No dizziness, and no, I haven't fainted at all. Doctor: Have you had any diagnosis made by any physician, anything like diabetes or high blood pressure? Patient: Yeah, I've been told I have high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Doctor: Okay, and do you take any medications for these things? Patient: I do take medications for both blood pressure and cholesterol: rosuvastatin and lisinopril, and I take a multivitamin. Doctor: And do you have any allergies to any medications at all? Patient: No allergies. Doctor: Have you at all in the past been hospitalized for any reason? Patient: No hospitalizations. Any previous surgeries? No. Doctor: And within your family, has anyone passed away from a heart attack or any cancers that run in the family? Patient: No. Doctor: And currently, right now, do you live alone? Do you live with someone? And where do you live? Like an apartment or house? Patient: I live in a house with my parents. Doctor: And do you currently work? Patient: Yeah, I drive a bus for the city. Doctor: And in your daily routine, would you say you get enough exercise throughout the week? Patient: Yeah, usually on Sundays I'll go for a run. Doctor: And how about your diet? How's your diet? Like, just regularly. Patient: Usually, I feel like it's fairly balanced overall. I might eat out a little bit too often, but try to eat as many vegetables as I can. Doctor: And do you smoke cigarettes at all? Patient: I do, yes. I've been smoking for the last 20 years, roughly. Doctor: How much do you smoke on an average day? Patient: About a half a pack to a pack a day. Doctor: And do you drink? Patient: No alcohol. Doctor: And any recreational drugs like marijuana? Patient: No marijuana, but I have used crystal meth in the past. Doctor: Okay, and when was the last time that you used crystal meth? Patient: Six days ago. Doctor: Okay. And how often do you use crystal meth? Patient: I would say a couple of times a month. Doctor: And for how long have you been using crystal now? Patient: For the last seven years. Doctor: Seven years. Okay, thank you, Mr. Malhotra. Letâ€™s proceed with further evaluation and management based on the findings."""
